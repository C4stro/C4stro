# About
As a senior developer with experience in team leadership and backlog management, I have led teams of over 14 people during my career. I have worked on integration projects using .NET, and I have experience with ERP systems. I have also worked as a PO, SM, and database analyst. My technical skills include NodeJS, ReactJS, PHP, and C#.

In addition to my professional work, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with junior developers. I have mentored several developers in the past, and I run a social project called "Adopt a Developer," which provides free mentoring to new developers.

With experience in both desktop and web projects, I am confident in my ability to tackle any technical challenge that comes my way. I believe that knowledge should be shared freely, and that it is our responsibility to make the world a better place by democratizing access to education and information.
